# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

Our job was to analyze employee data from Pewlett Hackard and find out how many employees in each job class were eligible to retire. Once that was discovered, we helped filter those results to make a list of employees who could come back part time to work in a mentorship program with the newer employees. We also offered some helpful insights to Pewlett Hackard on how to best move forward.

### **Results**

- 72,458 possible retirees at any given time (30% of the workforce!)
- 50,842 of those retirees are senior level staff and could effect the productivity of the company
- 1,549 possible mentors
- See table below for full 'Silver Tsunami' retirement positions:

## **Summary**

In the next few years, Pewlett Hackard will need to hire and train for 72,458 positions, which represents a very large percentage of their workforce. For reference, see the query below for the total current employees. On top of that, only 1,549 of those retirees are eligible to be mentors to new hires. That represents barely over 2% of that group, and might not provide enough support to meaningfully mentor the new hires. <i>If</i> everyone eligible mentored, <i>and</i> everyone retired equally over the next 5 years (about 14,500 a year), then they would have about 10 new hires to mentor a year. This could be easily done if new hires came in in equal hiring groups over the year, whether quarterly or twice a year. That being said, it's very hard to predict when someone will want to retire and too much to hope that all new hires work out.

There are a couple things that Pewlett Hackard could implement to ease their next few years. The first is to loosen the age requirement for mentors. Even allowing six more months on the age criteria allows almost 11,000 more retiring employees to be mentors.

Another option is PH could offer incentives, either for becoming a mentor or for delaying retirement. Obviously, this could add a large sum to the operating budget and would need to be weighed against what it will cost to train and hire, and how much might be lost if too many employees retire without being replaced.
