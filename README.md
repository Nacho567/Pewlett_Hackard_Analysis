# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

Our job was to analyze employee data from Pewlett Hackard and find out how many employees in each job class were eligible to retire. Once that was discovered, we helped filter those results to make a list of employees who could come back part time to work in a mentorship program with the newer employees. We also offered some helpful insights to Pewlett Hackard on how to best move forward.

### **Results**

- 72,458 possible retirees at any given time (% of the workforce)
- 50,842 of those retirees are senior level staff and could effect the productivity of the company
- 1,549 possible mentors
- See table below for full 'Silver Tsunami' retirement positions:

## **Summary**

In the next few years, Pewlett Hackard will need to hire and train for 72,458 positions, which represents a large percentage of their workforce. Even On top of that, only 1,549 of those retirees are eligible to be mentors to new hires. That represents barely over 2% of that group.
