# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

Our job was to analyze employee data from Pewlett Hackard and find out how many employees in each job class were eligible to retire. Once that was discovered, we helped filter those results to make a list of employees who could come back part time to work in a mentorship program with the newer employees.

### **Results**

- 72,458 possible retirees at any given time (% of the workforce)
- 50,842 of those retirees are senior level staff and could effect the productivity of the company
